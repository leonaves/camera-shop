Dear Mr Symons,

This coursework will only hinder the progress of your students actually getting a career in web development. The entire codebase is a mess or poorly formatted, poorly thought out garbage. Before you start inflicting your poor coding habits on your pupils, I'd suggest you go read a couple of style guides, for both your PHP and Javascript. I'd suggest http://php-fig.org/psr/psr-2 and https://github.com/airbnb/javascript respectively.

Additionally, and arguably more importantly, please stop teaching jQuery to those being initiated into the Javascript world. We have enough bad programmers in the industry without you churning out a bunch from your bullshit course. Take a look at the following article if it will help convince you: http://lea.verou.me/2015/04/jquery-considered-harmful/

You should be teaching the fundementals of Javascript and how its concerns differ from the Web APIs, not leading your students into conflating jQuery and Javascript as so many front-end developers already do. As you can see I've completed your bullshit task using no jQuery APIs, and I've no doubt the whole codebase could easily be re-written in vanilla js (http://vanilla-js.com).

Lastly, if you need any coding advice, do feel free to reach out as I would be happy to help you along, or you could simply take a look at codeacademy (perhaps your students would be better off there too?)
